<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>"THAT SWINNEY."</h3>

  <p>Junius thus wrote to H. S. Woodfall in a private note, to which Dr.
  Good has affixed the date July 21st, 1769 (vol. i. p. 174.*)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That Swinney is a wretched but dangerous fool. He had the impudence
  to go to Lord G. Sackville, whom he had never spoken to, and to ask him
  whether or no he was the author of Junius: take care of him."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This paragraph has given rise to a great deal of speculation, large
  inferences have been drawn from it, yet no one has satisfactorily
  answered the question, who was "that Swinney?"</p>

  <p>That neither Dr. Good nor Mr. George Woodfall, the editors of the
  edit. of 1812, knew anything about him, is manifest from their own bald
  note of explanation, "A correspondent of the printers." Some reports say
  that he was a collector of news for the <i>Public Advertiser</i>, and
  subsequently a bookseller at Birmingham, but I never saw any one fact
  adduced tending to show that there was any person of that name so
  employed. Others that the Rev. Dr. Sidney Swinney was the party referred
  to: and Mr. Smith, in his excellent notes to the <i>Grenville Papers</i>,
  vol. iii. p. lxviii., <i>assumes</i> this to be the fact. I incline to
  agree with him, but have only inference to strengthen conjecture. What
  may be the value of that inference will appear in the progress of this
  inquiry, Who was Dr. Sidney Swinney?</p>

  <p>Reports collected by Mr. Butler, Mr. Barker, Mr. Coventry, and others,
  say that the Doctor had been chaplain to the Russian Embassy, chaplain to
  the Embassy at Constantinople, and chaplain to one of the British
  regiments serving in Germany. Mr. Falconer, in his <i>Secret
  Revealed</i>, p. 22., quotes a paragraph from one of Wray's letters to
  Lord Hardwick with reference to the proceedings at the Royal Society:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Dr. Swinney, your Lordship's friend, presented his father-in-law
  Howell's book."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Swinney's father-in-law, here called Howell, was John Zephaniah
  Holwell, a remarkable man, whose name is intimately associated with the
  early history of British India, one of the few survivors of the Black
  Hole imprisonment, the successor of <!-- Page 214 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>{214}</span>Clive as governor, and
  a writer on many subjects connected with Hindoo antiquities. Swinney
  enrols him amongst his heroes,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Holwell, Clive, York, Lawrence, Adams, Coote,</p>
      <p>Of Draper, Bath-strung for his baffled suit."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And he refers, in a note, to those</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ungrateful monsters (heretofore in a certain trading company), who
  have endeavoured to vilify and sully one of the brightest characters that
  ever existed."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I learn farther, from a volume of <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, published by
  Dr. Swinney, that he was the son of Major Mathew Swinney, whom after his
  flourishing fashion he calls on another occasion "Mathew Swinney of
  immortal memory;" from one of his dedications that the Doctor himself was
  educated at Eton; from the books of the Royal Society that he was of
  Clare Hall, Cambridge; from dates and dedications, that from 1764 to
  1768, he was generally resident at Scarborough; and from the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, that he died there 12th November, 1783.</p>

  <p>That Swinney had been chaplain to the Russian Embassy I have no reason
  to believe; but that he had been in the East for a time, possibly as
  chaplain to the Embassy at Constantinople, is asserted in the brief
  biographical notice in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and would <i>seem
  to be proved</i> by a work which he published in 1769, called&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Tour through some parts of the Levant: in which is included An
  Account of the Present State of the Seven Churches in Asia. Also a brief
  Explanation of the Apocalypse. By Sidney Swinney, D.D."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Nothing, however, can be inferred from a title-page of Swinney's. Here
  we have two or three distinct works referred to:&mdash;<i>A Tour</i>,
  including "An Account of the Seven Churches," and the "Explanation of the
  Apocalypse." Now I must direct attention to the fact, that from the
  peculiar punctuation and phraseology&mdash;the full-stop after Asia in
  this title-page&mdash;it may have been Swinney's intention to indicate,
  without asserting, that the Account of the Apocalypse <i>only</i> was by
  Sidney Swinney. If so, though Swinney's name alone figures in the
  title-page of the work, he is responsible only for one or two notes!</p>

  <p>I would not have written conjecturally on this subject if I could have
  avoided it; but though Swinney was a F.A.S. F.R.S., and though the work
  is dedicated to the Fellows of those Societies, no copy of it is to be
  found in the libraries of either, or in the British Museum. I cannot,
  therefore, be sure that my own copy is perfect. What that copy contains
  is thus set forth in half a dozen lines of introduction:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Before I [S. S.] enter upon the more important part of my
  dissertation [The Explanation of the Apocalypse], it may not be improper
  to give you some account of the present state of the Seven Churches in
  Asia, as they are, <i>which was communicated to me</i> by a certain
  <i>friend of mine</i>, in the description of a short tour which <i>he</i>
  made through the principal parts of the Levant: should they be
  accompanied with a few casual notes <i>of my own</i>, I trust the work
  will not be less acceptable to you on that account."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It must be obvious, after this declaration, that the <i>Tour</i> set
  forth so conspicuously in the title-page, was not written by Swinney. Now
  the "Itinerary" which follows is advowedly "wrote by <i>the author of the
  preceding account</i>," and this brings the reader and the work itself to
  "The End!"</p>

  <p>The truth I suspect to have been this:&mdash;Swinney was not prudent
  and was poor, and raised money occasionally, after the miserable fashion
  of the time, by publishing books on subscription, and receiving
  subscriptions in anticipation of publication.</p>

  <p>About this time, from 1767 to 1769, he published a <i>Sermon</i>;
  <i>The Ninth Satire of Horace</i>, a meaningless trifle of a hundred
  lines, swollen, by printing the original and notes, into a quarto; a
  volume of <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>; and the first canto of <i>The Battle of
  Minden, a Poem in three Books, enriched with critical Notes by Two
  Friends, and with explanatory Notes by the Author</i>. Of the latter
  work, as of the <i>Tour</i>, I have never seen but one copy, a splendid
  specimen of typography, splendidly bound, containing the first and second
  canto. Whether the third canto was ever published is to me doubtful; some
  of your correspondents may be able to give you information. My own
  impression is that it was not, and for the following reasons.</p>

  <p>Swinney, it appears, had received subscriptions for the work, and
  promised in his prospectus <i>a plan of the battle</i>, and
  <i>portraits</i> of the heroes, which the work does not contain.
  "However, to make some little amends" to his "generous subscribers,"
  Swinney announces his intention to present them with "<i>three</i> books
  instead of <i>one</i>."</p>

  <p>The first book is dedicated to Earl Waldegrave, who commanded "the six
  British regiments of infantry" on the "ever memorable 1st August, 1759,"
  and a note affixed states that "Book the Second" will be published on 1st
  January, and "Book the Third" on 1st of August.</p>

  <p>But the public, as Swinney says, were kept "in suspense" almost three
  years for the second book, which was not published until 1772; and in the
  dedication of this second book, also to Earl Waldegrave, Swinney
  says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Doubtless many of my subscribers have thought me very unmindful of
  the promise I made them in my printed proposal, in which I undertook to
  publish my poem out of hand. Ill health has been the sole cause of my
  disappointing their expectations. A fever of the nerves ... for these
  four years, has rendered me incapable.... In my original proposals I
  undertook to publish this work in two books. [In the introduction he
  says, as I have just quoted, <i>one</i> book.] Poetical <!-- Page 215
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>{215}</span>matter hath
  increased upon me to such a degree, in the genial climate of Languedoc,
  as to have enabled me to compose several more books on this interesting
  subject, all which I purpose presenting my subscribers with at the
  original price of half a guinea.... Many months ago this Second Book was
  printed off; but on my arrival in town from Montauban (whither I purpose
  to return), I found there were so many faults and blunders in it
  throughout, that I was under the necessity of condemning five hundred
  copies to the inglorious purpose of defending pye bottoms from the dust
  of an oven.... Profit, my Lord, has not been my motive for publishing: if
  it had, I should be egregiously disappointed, for instead of gaining I
  shall be a considerable loser by the publication; and yet many of my
  subscribers have <i>given me four, five, and six times over and above the
  subscription-price for my Poem. How even the remaining books will see the
  light must depend entirely upon my pecuniary, not my poetical
  abilities</i>. The work is well nigh completed; but not one solitary
  brother have I throughout the airy regions of Grub Street who is poorer
  than I. It is not impossible, however, but when <i>some of my partial
  friends shall know this</i>, they may <i>enable me by their bounty</i> to
  publish out of hand."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This leads me to doubt whether the third book was ever published, for
  I think the most "partial" of his friends&mdash;those who had given
  "four, five, and six times over and above the subscription
  price"&mdash;must have had enough in two books. If it were not published,
  it is a curious fact that, in a poem called <i>The Battle of Minden</i>,
  the battle of Minden is not mentioned; though not more extraordinary
  perhaps than the omissions of the "Explanation of the Apocalypse" in his
  previous work.</p>

  <p>I come now to the question, Why did Junius speak so passionately and
  disrespectfully of Swinney, and what are the probabilities that Swinney
  had never before (July) 1769 spoken to Lord G. Sackville? These I must
  defer till next week.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Superstition of the Cornish Miners</i> (Vol. viii., p. 7.).&mdash;I
  cannot find the information desired by your correspondent in the Cornish
  antiquaries, and have in vain consulted other works likely to explain
  this tradition; but the remarks now offered will perhaps be interesting
  in reference to the <i>nation</i> alluded to. The Carthaginians being of
  the same race, manners, and religion as the Ph&oelig;nicians, there are
  no particular data by which we can ascertain the time of their first
  trading to the British coast for the commodity in such request among the
  traders of the East. The genius of Carthage being more martial than that
  of Tyre, whose object was more commerce than conquest, it is not
  improbable that the former might by force of arms have established a
  settlement in the Cassiterides, and by this means have secured that
  monopoly of tin which the Ph&oelig;nicians and their colonies indubitably
  enjoyed for several centuries. Norden, in his <i>Antiquities of
  Cornwall</i>, mentions it as a tradition universally received by the
  inhabitants, that their tin mines were formerly wrought by the Jews. He
  adds that these old works are there at this day called Attal Sarasin, the
  ancient <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span>cast-off works of the Saracens, in which
  their tools are frequently found. Miners are not accustomed to be very
  accurate in distinguishing traders of foreign nations, and these Jews and
  Saracens have probably a reference to the old merchants from Spain and
  Africa; and those employed by them might possibly have been Jews escaped
  the horrors of captivity and the desolation which about that period befel
  their country.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Jews," says Whitaker (<i>Origin of Arianism</i>, p. 334.),
  "denominated themselves, and were denominated by the Britons of Cornwall,
  <i>Saracens</i>, as the genuine progeny of Sarah. The same name, no
  doubt, carried the same reference with it as borne by the genuine, and as
  usurped by the spurious, offspring of Abraham."</p>

  <p><i>Northamptonshire Folk Lore</i> (Vol. vii., p. 146.).&mdash;In
  Norfolk, a ring made from nine sixpences freely given by persons of the
  opposite sex is considered a charm against epilepsy. I have seen nine
  sixpences brought to a silversmith, with a request that he would make
  them into a ring; but 13½<i>d.</i> was not tendered to him for making,
  nor do I think that any threehalfpences are collected for payment. After
  the patient had left the shop, the silversmith informed me that such
  requests were of frequent occurrence, and that he supplied the patients
  with thick silver rings, but never took the trouble to manufacture them
  from the sixpences.</p>

  <p>A similar superstition supposes that the sole of the left shoe of a
  person of the same age, but opposite sex, to the patient, reduced to
  ashes is a cure for St. Anthony's fire. I have seen it applied with
  success, but suppose its efficacy is due to some astringent principle in
  the ashes.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>On Two Passages in Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;Taking up a day or two
  since a Number of "N. &amp; Q.," my attention was drawn to a new attempt
  to give a solution of the difficulty which has been the torment of
  commentators in the following passage from the Third Act of <i>Romeo and
  Juliet</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,</p>
      <p>Towards Ph&oelig;bus' mansion; such a waggoner</p>
      <p>As Phaeton would whip you to the West,</p>
      <p>And bring in cloudy night immediately.&mdash;</p>
      <p>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing Night,</p>
      <p>That <i>runaways'</i> eyes may wink, and Romeo</p>
      <p>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"Runaways'" being a manifest absurdity, the recent editors have
  substituted "unawares," an uncouth alteration, which, though it has a
  glimmering of sense, appears to me almost as absurd as the word it
  supplies. In this <span class="correction" title="text reads `dilemna'"
  >dilemma</span> your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>
  ingeniously suggests the true reading to be,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That <i>rumourers'</i> eyes may wink, and Romeo</p>
      <p>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>No doubt this is a felicitous emendation, though I think it may be
  fairly objected that a rumourer, being one who deals in what he hears, as
  opposed to an observer, who reports what he sees, there is a certain
  inappropriateness in speaking of a rumourer's eyes. Be this as it may, I
  beg to suggest another reading, which has the merit of having
  spontaneously occurred to me on seeing the word "runaways'" in your
  correspondent's paper, as if obviously suggested by the combination of
  letters in that word. I propose that the passage should be read thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Spread thy close curtain, love-performing Night,</p>
      <p>That <i>rude day's</i> eyes may wink, and Romeo</p>
      <p>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A subsequent reference to Juliet's speech has left no doubt in my mind
  that this is the true reading, and so obviously so, as to make it a
  wonder that it should have been overlooked. She first asks the
  "fiery-footed steeds" to bring in "cloudy night," then night to close her
  curtain (that day's eyes may wink), that darkness may come, under cover
  of which Romeo may hasten to her. In the next two lines she shows why
  this darkness is propitious, and then, using an unwonted epithet, invokes
  night to give her the opportunity of darkness:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"Come, <i>civil</i> night,</p>
      <p>Thou sober suited matron all in black,</p>
      <p>And learn me how to lose a winning game," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The peculiar and unusual epithet "civil," here applied to night, at
  once assured me of the accuracy of the proposed reading, it having
  evidently suggested itself as the antithesis of "rude" just before
  applied to day; the civil, accommodating, concealing night being thus
  contrasted with the unaccommodating, revealing day. It is to be remarked,
  moreover, that as this epithet <i>civil</i> is, through its ordinary
  signification, brought into connexion with what precedes it, so is it,
  through its unusual meaning of <i>grave</i>, brought into connexion with
  what follows, it thus furnishing that equivocation of sense of which our
  great dramatist is so fond, rarely missing an opportunity of "paltering
  with us in a double sense."</p>

  <p>I think, therefore, I may venture to offer you the proposed emendation
  as rigorously fulfilling all the requirements of the text, while at the
  same time it necessitates a very trifling literal disturbance of the old
  reading, since by the simple change of the letters <i>naw</i> into
  <i>ded</i>, we convert "runaways'" into "rude day's," of which it was a
  very easy misprint.</p>

  <p>Having offered you an emendation of my own, I cannot miss the
  opportunity of sending you <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>{217}</span>another, for which I am indebted to a
  critical student of Shakspeare, my friend Mr. W.&nbsp;R. Grove, the Queen's
  Counsel. In <i>All's Well that ends Well</i>, the third scene of the
  Second Act opens with the following speech from Lafeu:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to
  make modern and familiar things, supernatural and causeless. Hence is it
  that we make trifles of terrors; ensconcing ourselves in a seeming
  knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On reading this passage as thus printed, it will be seen that the two
  sentences of which it is composed are in direct contradiction to each
  other; the first asserting that we have philosophers who give a causeless
  and supernatural character to things ordinary and familiar: the second
  stating as the result of this, "that we make trifles of terrors," whereas
  the tendency would necessarily be to make "terrors of trifles." The
  confusion arises from the careless pointing of the first sentence. By
  simply shifting the comma at present after "things," and placing it after
  "familiar," the discrepancy between the two sentences disappears, as also
  between the two members of the first sentence, which are now at variance.
  It should be pointed thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to
  make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is singular that none of the editors should have noticed this
  defect, which I have no doubt will hereafter be removed by the adoption
  of a simple change, that very happily illustrates the importance of
  correct punctuation.</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare's Skull</i>.&mdash;As your publication has been the
  medium of many valuable comments upon Shakspeare, and interesting matter
  connected with him, I am induced to solicit information, if you will
  allow me, on the following subject. I have the <i>Works of
  Shakspeare</i>, which being in one volume 8vo., I value as being more
  portable than any other edition. It was published by Sherwood without any
  date affixed, but probably about 1825. There is a memoir prefixed by Wm.
  Harvey, Esq., in which, p. xiii., it is stated that while a vault was
  being made close to Shakspeare's, when Dr. Davenport was rector, a young
  man perceiving the tomb of Shakspeare open, introduced himself so far
  within the vault that he could have brought away the skull, but he was
  deterred from doing so by the anathema inscribed on the monument,
  of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Curs'd be he that moves my bones."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is given upon the authority of Dr. Nathan Drake's work on
  Shakspeare, in two vols. 4to. Now in this work much is given which is
  copied into the memoir, but I do not there find this anecdote, and
  perhaps some reader of "N. &amp; Q." may supply this deficiency, and
  state where I may find it. I may be allowed to state, that Pope's skull
  was similarly stolen and another substituted.</p>

  time of his work, taken place.</p>

  <p><i>Dog Latin</i>.&mdash;The answer of one of your late correspondents
  (E. M. B., Vol. vii., p. 622.) on the subject of "Latin&mdash;Latiner,"
  has revived a Query in your First Volume (p. 230.) as to the origin of
  this expression which does not appear to have been answered. I do not
  remember having seen any explanation of the term, but I have arrived at
  one for myself, and present it to your readers for what it is worth.
  Nothing, it must be admitted, can be more inconsistent with the usual
  forms of language than the Latin of mediæval periods; it is often, in
  fact, not Latin at all, but merely a Latin form given to simple English
  or other words, and admitting of the greatest variety. Now of all animals
  the distinctions of breed are perhaps more numerous in the canine race
  than any other. The word "mongrel," originally applied to one of these
  quadruped combinations of variety, has long been used to signify anything
  in which mixture of class existed, especially of a debasing kind, to
  which such mixture generally tends. Nothing could be more appropriate
  than the application of the term to the "infima latinitas" of the Middle
  Ages; and from "mongrel" the transition to the name of the genus from
  that of the degenerate species appears to me to be very easy, though
  fanciful.</p>

  <p><i>Thomas Wright of Durham</i>.&mdash;In the <i>Philosophical
  Magazine</i> for April, 1848, I gave an account of the "Original Theory
  or new Hypothesis of the Universe" of Thomas Wright, whose anticipations
  of modern speculation on the milky way, the central sun, and some other
  points, make him one of the most remarkable astronomical thinkers of his
  day. In the biography in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for 1793, he is
  described as struggling for a livelihood when a young man, and no account
  is given of the manner in which he obtained the handsome competence with
  which he emerges in 1756, or thereabouts. A few days after my account was
  published, I was informed (by Captain James, R.E.) that a large four-foot
  orrery, constructed by Wright for the Royal Academy at Portsmouth, was
  still in that town; and that by the title of "J. Harrises Use of the
  Globes" it appears that he (Wright) kept his shop at the <i>Orrery</i>,
  near Water Lane, Fleet Street (No. 136), under the title of
  instrument-maker to his Majesty. In an edition of Harris (the 8th, 1767),

<h3>LITTLECOTT&mdash;SIR JOHN POPHAM.</h3>

  <p>Every one knows the tradition attached to the manor of Littlecott in
  Wiltshire, and the alleged means by which Chief Justice Sir John Popham
  acquired its possession. It is told by Aubrey, Sir Walter Scott, and many
  others, and is too notorious to be here repeated. Let me ask you or your
  learned correspondents whether there exists any refutation of a charge so
  seriously detrimental to the character of any judge, and so inconsistent
  with the reputation which Chief Justice Popham enjoyed among his
  cotemporaries? See Lord Ellesmere's notice of him in the case of the
  Postnati (<i>State Trials</i>, ii. 669.), and Sir Edward Coke's
  flattering picture of him at the end of Sir Drew Drury's case
  (<i>Reports</i>, vi. 75.). Are there any records showing that a Darell
  was ever in fact arraigned on a charge of murder, and the name of the
  judge who presided at the trial? Is the date known of the death of the
  last Darell who possessed the estate, or that of Sir John Popham's
  acquisition of it? The discovery of these might throw great light on the
  subject, and possibly afford a complete contradiction.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis Bacon, in his argument against Sir John Hollis and others
  for traducing public justice, states that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Popham, a great judge in his time, was complained of by petition to
  Queen Elizabeth; it was committed <!-- Page 219 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span>to four privy
  councillors, but the same was found to be slanderous, and the parties
  punished in the court."&mdash;<i>State Trials</i>, vol. ii. p. 1029.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If this petition could be discovered, and it should turn out that the
  slander complained of in it had reference to this story, the
  investigation which it then underwent by the four privy councillors, and
  the chief justice's enjoyment of his high office for so many subsequent
  years, would go far to prove the utter falsehood of the charge. This is a
  "consummation devoutly to be wished" by every one who feels an interest
  in the purity of the bench, and particularly by the present possessors of
  the estate, who must be anxious for their ancestor's fame.</p>

  <p>Your useful publication has acted the part of the "detective police"
  in the elucidation of many points of history less interesting than this,
  and I trust you will consider the case curious enough to justify a close
  examination.</p>

<h3>EARLY EDITION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</h3>

  <p>I should be greatly obliged if I could obtain through "N. &amp; Q."
  when, where, and by whom an imperfect black-letter copy of the New
  Testament, lately come into my possession, was printed, and also who was
  the translator of it.</p>

  <p>It is bound in boards, has three thongs round which the sheets are
  stitched, seems never to have been covered with cloth, leather, or other
  material like our modern books, has had clasps, and is four inches long
  and two inches thick.</p>

  <p>The chapters are divided generally into four or five parts by means of
  the first letters of the alphabet. The letters are neither placed
  equidistant, nor do they always mark a fresh paragraph.</p>

  <p>It is not divided into verses. There are a few marginal references,
  and the chapter and letter of the parallel passages are given.</p>

  <p>Crosses are placed at the heads of most chapters, and also throughout
  the text, without much apparent regularity. It contains a few rude cuts
  of the Apostles, &amp;c. The Epistles of St. Peter and St. John are
  placed before that to the Hebrews.</p>

  <p>Letters are frequently omitted in the spelling, and this is indicated
  by a dash placed over the one preceding the omitted letter. A slanting
  mark (/) is the most frequent stop used. I will transcribe a few lines
  exactly as they occur, only not using the black-letter.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Brasenose, Oxford</i>.&mdash;I am anxious to learn the origin and
  meaning of the word <i>Brasenose</i>. I have somewhere heard or read
  (though I cannot recall where) that it was a Saxon word, <i>brasen
  haus</i> or "brewing-house;" and that the college was called by this
  name, because it was built on the site of the brewing-house of King
  Alfred. All that Ingram says on the subject is this:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This curious appellation, which, whatever was the origin of it, has
  been perpetuated by the symbol of a brazen nose here and at Stamford,
  occurs with the modern orthography, but in one undivided word, so early
  as 1278, in an Inquisition, now printed in the <i>Hundred Rolls</i>,
  though quoted by Wood from the manuscript record."&mdash;See his
  <i>Memorials of Oxford</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span>, B.A.

<div class="note">
  <p>[Our correspondent will find the notice of King Alfred's brew-house in
  the review of Ingram's <i>Memorials</i> in the <i>British Critic</i>,
  vol. xxiv. p. 139. The writer says, "There is a spot in the centre of the
  city where Alfred is said to have lived, and which may be called the
  native place or river-head of three separate societies still existing,
  University, Oriel, and Brasenose. Brasenose claims his palace, Oriel his
  church, and University his school or academy. Of these Brasenose College
  is still called, in its formal style, 'the King's Hall,' which is the
  name by which Alfred himself, in his laws, calls his palace; and it has
  its present singular name from a corruption of <i>brasinium</i>, or
  <i>brasin-huse</i>, as having been originally located in that part of the
  royal mansion which was devoted to the then important accommodation of a
  brew-house." Churton, in his <i>Life of Bishop Smyth</i>, p. 277., thus
  accounts for the origin of the word:&mdash;"Brasen Nose Hall, as the
  Oxford antiquary has shown, may be traced as far back as the time of
  Henry III., about the middle of the thirteenth century; and early in the
  succeeding reign, 6th Edward I., 1278, it was known by the name of Brasen
  Nose Hall, which peculiar name was undoubtedly owing, as the same author
  observes, to the circumstance of a nose of brass affixed to the gate. It
  is presumed, however, this conspicuous appendage of the portal was not
  formed of the mixed metal, which the word now denotes, but the genuine
  produce of the mine; as is the nose, or rather face, of a lion or leopard
  still remaining at Stamford, which also gave name to the edifice it
  adorned. And hence, when Henry VIII. debased the coin, by an alloy of
  <i>copper</i>, it was a common remark or proverb, that 'Testons were gone
  to Oxford, to study in <i>Brasen</i> Nose.'"]</p>

  <p>[In Pepys's <i>Diary</i>, vol. i. p. 2. edit. 1848, occurs the

  stating that Sir George Downing was a son of Dr. Calibut Downing, the
  rector of Hackney. He was beyond doubt the son of Emmanuel Downing, a
  London merchant, who went to New England. It is not improbable that
  Emmanuel was a near kinsman of Calibut; how related has not yet been
  discovered. Governor Hutchinson, in his <i>History of Massachusetts</i>,
  gives the true account of Downing's affiliation, which has been farther
  confirmed by Mr. Savage, of Boston, from the public records of New
  England. Wood calls Downing a sider with all times and changes; skilled
  in the common cant, and a preacher occasionally. He was sent by Cromwell
  to Holland, as resident there. About the Restoration, he espoused the
  King's cause, and was knighted and elected M. P. for Morpeth, in 1661.
  Afterwards, becoming Secretary to the Treasury and Commissioner of the
  Customs, he was in 1663 created a Baronet of East Hatley, in
  Cambridgeshire, and was again sent ambassador to Holland. His grandson of
  the same name, who died in 1749, was the founder of Downing College,
  Cambridge. The title became extinct in 1764, upon the decease of Sir John
  Gerrard Downing, the last heir male of the family." According to
  Hutchinson, Sir George died in 1684.]</p>

  applied to circumstances of a melancholy or distressing character, but
  sometimes used to express a peculiar state of feeling, being apparently
  intended to convey nearly the same meaning as the <i>ennui</i> of the
  French. I <!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  somewhere in Miss Mitford's writings, who speaks of it as peculiar to

  <p>[Mr. George Offor, in his Introduction to <i>The Pilgrim's

  death, this third part made its appearance; and although the title does
  not directly say that it was written by Bunyan, yet it was at first
  generally received as such. In 1695, it reached a second edition; and a
  sixth in 1705. In 1708, it was denounced in the title to the ninth
  edition of the second part, by a 'Note, <i>the third part, suggested to
  be J. Bunyan's, is an imposture</i>.' The author of this forgery is as
  yet unknown." Mr. Offor has also devoted fifty pages of his Introduction
  to the conjectured prototypes of Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. He
  says, "Every assertion or suggestion that came to my knowledge has been
  investigated, and the works referred to have been analysed. And beyond
  this, every allegorical work that could be found, previous to the
  eighteenth century, has been examined in all the European languages, and

<h3>CRANMER AND CALVIN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 182.)</p>

  <p>A correspondent who seems to delight in sibilants, signing, himself
  S.&nbsp;Z.&nbsp;Z.&nbsp;S., invites me to "<i>preserve</i>, in your columns, the letter
  of Calvin to Cranmer, of which Dean Jenkyns has only given extracts," as
  noticed by me in your Vol. vii., p. 621.</p>

  <p>I would not shrink from the trouble of transcribing the whole letter,
  if a complete copy were only to be found in the short-lived columns of a
  newspaper, as inserted in the <i>Record</i> of May 15, 1843, by Merle
  d'Aubigné; but the Dean has given a reference to the volume in which both
  the letters he cites are preserved and accessible, viz. <i>Calvin
  Epistles</i>, pp. 134, 135., Genev. 1616. <!-- Page 223 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>{223}</span></p>

  <p>S. Z. Z. S. justly observes that there are two points to be
  distinguished: first, Cranmer's wish that Calvin should assist in a
  general union of the churches protesting against Romish errors; second,
  Calvin's offer to assist in settling the Church of England. He adds, "The
  latter was declined; and the reason is demonstrated in Archbishop
  Laurence's <i>Bampton Lectures</i>." I neither possess those lectures,
  nor the volume of Calvin's epistles; but all I have seen of the
  correspondence between him and Cranmer, in the Parker Society's editions
  of Cranmer, and of original letters between 1537-58, and in Jenkyns'
  <i>Remains of Cranmer</i>, indisposes me to believe that Calvin made any
  "offer to assist in settling the Church of England." It appears from Dean
  Jenkyns' note, vol. i. p. 346., that Archbishop Laurence made a mistake
  in the order of the correspondence, calculated to mislead himself; and as
  to Heylyn's assertion, <i>Eccles. Restaur.</i>, p. 65., that Calvin made
  such an offer and "that the Archbishop (Cranmer) <i>knew</i> the man and
  refused his offer," the Dean says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He gives no authority for the later part of his statement, and it can
  hardly be reconciled with Cranmer's letter to Calvin of March 20,
  1552."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The contemptuous expression, he "knew the man and refused his offer,"
  is, in fact, utterly irreconcilable with Cranmer's language in all his
  three letters to Melancthon, to Bullinger, and to Calvin (Nos. 296, 297,
  298. of Parker Society's edition of <i>Cranmer's Remains</i>, and Nos.
  283, 284, 285. of Jenkyns' edition), where he tells each of the other two
  that he had written to Calvin from his desire&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ut in Anglia, aut alibi, doctissimorum et <i>optimorum</i> virorum
  synodus convocaretur, in qua de puritate ecclesiasticæ doctrinæ, et
  præcipue de consensu controversiæ sacramentariæ tractaretur."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Or, as he said to Calvin himself:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ut docti et pii viri, qui alios antecellunt eruditione et judicio,
  convenirent."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Your correspondent seems to have used the word "demonstrated" rather
  in a surgical than in its mathematical sense.</p>

  <p>Having taken up my pen to supply you with an answer to this historical
  inquiry, I may as well notice some other articles in your No. 199. For
  example, in p. 167., L. need not have referred your readers to
  Halliwell's <i>Researches in Archaic Language</i> for an explanation of
  Bacon's word "bullaces." The word may be seen in Johnson's
  <i>Dictionary</i>, with the citation from Bacon, and instead of vaguely
  calling it "a small black and tartish plum," your botanical readers know
  it as the <i>Prunus insititia</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, p. 173., J. M. may like to know farther, that the Duke of
  Wellington's clerical brother was entered on the boards of St. John's
  College, Cambridge, as Wesley, where the spelling must have been dictated
  either by himself, or by the person authorised to desire his admission.
  It continued to be spelt Wesley in the Cambridge annual calendars as late
  as 1808, but was altered in that of 1809 to Wellesley. The alteration was
  probably made by the desire of the family, and without communicating such
  desire to the registrary of the university. For it appears in the edition
  of <i>Graduati Cantabrigienses</i>, printed in 1823, as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wesley, Gerard Valerian, Coll. Joh. A. M. 1792. Comitis de
  Mornington, Fil. nat. 4<sup>tus</sup>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In p. 173., C. M. <span class="sc">Ingleby</span> may like to know, as
  a clue to the origin of his <i>apussee and</i>, that I was taught at
  school, sixty years ago, to call &amp; <i>And per se</i>, whilst some
  would call it <i>And-per-se-and</i>.</p>

  <p>In the same page, the inquirer B. H. C. respecting the word
  <i>mammon</i>, may like to know that the history of that word has been
  given at some length in p. 1. to p. 68. of the Parker Society's edition
  of Tyndale's <i>Parable of the wicked Mammon</i>, where I have stated
  that it occurs in a form identical with the English in the Chaldee Targum
  of Onkelos on Exod. viii. 21., and in that of Jonathan on Judges, v. 9.,
  as equivalent to riches; and that in the Syriac translation it occurs in
  a form identical with <span title="Mamôna" class="grk"
  >&Mu;&alpha;&mu;&omega;&nu;&#x1FB6;</span>, in Exod. xxi. 30., as a
  rendering for <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KOPER" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5B9;&#x5E4;&#x5B6;&#x5E8;</bdo></span>, the price of
  satisfaction. In B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C.'s citation from Barnes, <i>even</i> seems a
  misprint for <i>ever</i>. The Jews did not again fall into actual
  idolatry after the Babylonish captivity; but we are told that in the
  sight of God covetousness is idolatry.</p>

<h3>BARNACLES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 124.)</p>

  <p>A Querist quoting from Porta's <i>Natural Magic</i> the vulgar error
  that "not only in Scotland, but in the river Thames, there is a kind of
  shell-fish which get out of their shells and grow to be ducks, or such
  like birds," asks, what could give rise to such an absurd belief? Your
  correspondent quotes from the English translation of the <i>Magia
  Naturalis</i>, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1658; but the tradition is
  very ancient, Porta the author having died in 1515 <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> You still find an allusion in <i>Hudibras</i> to
  those&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Who from the most refin'd of saints,</p>
      <p>As naturally grow miscreants,</p>
      <p>As <i>barnacles</i> turn Soland geese,</p>
      <p>In th' islands of the Orcades."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The story has its origin in the peculiar formation of the little
  mollusc which inhabits the multivalve shell, the <i>Pentalasmis
  anatifera</i>, which by a fleshy peduncle attaches itself by one end to
  the bottoms of ships or floating timber, whilst from the other <!-- Page
  224 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>{224}</span>there
  protrudes a bunch of curling and fringe-like cirrhi, by the agitation of
  which it attracts and collects its food. These cirrhi so much resemble
  feathers, as to have suggested the leading idea of a bird's tail: and
  hence the construction of the remainder of the fable, which is thus given
  with grave minuteness in <i>The Herbal, or General Historie of
  Plants</i>, gathered by John Gerarde, Master in Chirurgerie: London,
  1597:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What our eyes have seen, and our hands have touched, we shall
  declare. There is a small island in Lancashire called the Pile of
  Foulders, wherein are found the broken pieces of old and bruised ships,
  some whereof have been cast thither by shipwreck; and also the trunks or
  bodies, with the branches of old and rotten trees, cast up there
  likewise, whereon is found a certain spume or froth, that in time
  breedeth unto certain shells, in shape like those of a mussel, but
  sharper pointed, and of a whitish colour; wherein is contained a thing in
  form like a lace of silk finely woven as it were together, of a whitish
  colour; one end whereof is fastened unto the inside of the shell, even as
  the fish of oysters and mussels are; the other end is made fast unto the
  belly of a rude mass or lump, which in time cometh to the shape and form
  of a bird. When it is perfectly formed, the shell gapeth open, and the
  first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or string; next come the
  legs of the bird hanging out and as it groweth greater, it openeth the
  shell by degrees, till at length it is all come forth, and hangeth only
  by the bill. In short space after it cometh to full maturity, and falleth
  into the sea, where it gathereth feathers, and groweth to a fowl, bigger
  than a mallard, and lesser than a goose; having black legs, and a bill or
  beak, and feathers black and white, spotted in such manner as our magpie,
  called in some places a Pie-Annet, which the people of Lancashire call by
  no other name than a tree-goose; which place aforesaid, and all those
  parts adjacent, do so much abound therewith, that one of the best may be
  bought for threepence. For the truth hereof, if any doubt, may it please
  them to repair unto me, and I shall satisfy them by the testimony of
  credible witnesses."&mdash;Page 1391.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Gerarde, who is doubtless Butler's authority, says elsewhere, that "in
  the north parts of Scotland, and the islands called Orcades," there are
  certain trees whereon these tree-geese and barnacles abound.</p>

  <p>The conversion of the fish into a bird, however fabulous, would be
  scarcely more astonishing than the metamorphosis which it actually
  undergoes&mdash;the young of the little animal having no feature to
  identify it with its final development. In its early stage (I quote from
  Carpenter's <i>Physiology</i>, vol. i. p. 52.) it has a form not unlike
  that of the crab, "possessing eyes and powers of free motion; but
  afterwards, becoming fixed to one spot for the remainder of its life, it
  loses its eyes and forms a shell, which, though composed of various
  pieces, has nothing in common with the jointed shell of the crab."</p>

  <p>Though Porta wrote at Naples, the story has reference to Scotland; and
  the tradition is evidently northern, and local. As to <span
  class="sc">Speriend</span>'s Query, What could give rise to so absurd a
  story? it doubtless took its origin in the similarity of the tentacles of
  the fish to feathers of a bird. But I would add the farther Query,
  whether the ready acceptance and general credence given to so obvious a
  fable, may not have been derived from giving too literal a construction
  to the text of the passage in the first chapter of Genesis:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And God said, Let the <i>waters bring forth abundantly</i> the moving
  creature that hath life, and <i>the fowl</i> that may fly in the open
  firmament of heaven?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Emerson Tennent.</span>

  <p>Drayton (1613) in his <i>Poly-olbion</i>, iii., in connexion with the
  river Dee, speaks of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Th' anatomised fish, and fowls from planchers sprung,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>to which a note is appended in Southey's edition, p. 609., that such
  fowls were "<i>barnacles</i>, a bird breeding upon old ships." In the
  <i>Entertaining Library</i>, "Habits of Birds," pp. 363-379., the whole
  story of this extraordinary instance of ignorance in natural history is
  amply developed. The barnacle shells which I once saw in a sea-port,
  attached to a vessel just arrived from the Mediterranean, had the
  brilliant appearance, at a distance, of flowers in bloom<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>; the foot of the
  <i>Lepas anatifera</i> (Linnæus) appearing to me like the stalk of a
  plant growing from the ship's side: the shell had the semblance of a
  calyx, and the flower consisted of the fingers (<i>tentacula</i>) of the
  shell-fish, "of which twelve project in an elegant curve, and are used by
  it for making prey of small fish." The very ancient error was to mistake
  the foot of the shell-fish for the neck of a goose, the shell for its
  head, and the <i>tentacula</i> for a tuft of feathers. As to the body,
  <i>non est inventus</i>. The Barnacle Goose is a well-known bird: and
  these shell-fish, bearing, as seen out of the water, resemblance to the
  goose's neck, were ignorantly, and without investigation, confounded with
  geese themselves, an error into which Albertus Magnus (d. 1280) did not
  fall, and in which Pope Pius II. proved himself infallible. Nevertheless,
  in France, the Barnacle Goose may be eaten on fast-days by virtue of this
  old belief in its marine origin.</p>

  <p>The difficulty in investigating the origin of this word is that the
  letter <i>c</i>, "the most wonderful of all letters," says Eichhoff
  (<i>Vergleichung der Sprachen</i>, p. 55.), sounds like <i>k</i> before
  the vowels <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, but before <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>,
  in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch, as <i>s</i>, in Italian as
  <i>tsh</i>, in German as <i>ts</i>. It is always <i>ts</i> in Polish and
  Bohemian. In Russian it is represented by a special letter <span
  lang="ru" title="ts" >&#x446;</span>, <i>tsi</i>; but in Celtic it is
  always <i>k</i>. Conformably with this principle, the Russians, like the
  Germans, Poles, and Bohemians, pronounce the Latin <i>c</i> as <i>ts</i>.
  So Cicero in these languages is pronounced <i>Tsitsero</i>, very
  differently from the Greeks, who called him <i>Kikero</i>. The letter
  <i>tsi</i> is a supplementary one in Russian, having no corresponding
  letter in the Greek alphabet, from which the Russian was formed in the
  ninth century by St. Cyril. The word to be sought then amongst cognate
  languages as the counterpart of <i>tsar</i> (or as the Germans write it
  <i>czar</i>) is <i>car</i>, as pronounced in English, French, Spanish,
  Portuguese, and Dutch. The most probable etymological connection that I
  can discover is with the Sanscrit <a href="images/201_014.png"><img
  src="images/201_014.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="Sanskrit:
  car" /></a> <i>car</i>, to move, to advance; the root of the Greek <span
  title="karrhon" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F71;&#x1FE4;&#x1FE5;&omicron;&nu;</span>, in English
  <i>car</i>, Latin <i>curro</i>, French <i>cours</i>. So Sanscrit
  <i>caras</i>, <i>carat</i>, movable, nimble; Greek <span title="chraôn" class="grk"
  >&chi;&rho;&#x1F71;&omega;&nu;</span>, Latin <i>currens</i>. And Sanscrit
  <i>câras</i>, motion, Greek <span title="choros" class="grk"
  >&chi;&#x1F79;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, Latin <i>currus</i>,
  <i>cursus</i>, French <i>char</i>, English <i>car</i>, <i>cart</i>,
  &amp;c. The early Russians were doubtless wanderers, an off-shoot of the
  people known to the Greeks as Scythians, and to the Hebrews and Arabians
  as Gog and Magog, who travelled in <i>cars</i>, occupying first one
  territory with their flocks, but not cultivating the land, then leaving
  it to nature and taking up another resting-place. It is certain that the
  Russians have many Asiatic words in their vocabulary, which must
  necessarily have occurred from their being for more than two centuries
  sometimes under Tatar, and sometimes under Mongol domination; and the
  origin of this word <i>tsar</i> or <i>car</i> may leave to be sought on
  the plateaus of North-east Asia. In the Shemitic tongues (Arabic, Hebrew,
  Persian, &amp;c.) no connexion of sound or meaning, so probable as the
  above Indo-European one, is to be found. The popular derivations of
  Nabupolassar, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, &amp;c., are not to be trusted.
  It is remarkable, however, that these names are significant in Russian.
  (See "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., pp. 432, 433, <i>note</i>.) The cuneatic
  inscriptions may yet throw light on these Assyrian names. In Russian the
  kingdom is <i>Tsarstvo</i>, the king <i>Tsar</i>, his queen
  <i>Tsarina</i>, his son is <i>Tsarevitch</i>, and his daughter
  <i>Tsarevna</i>. The word is probably pure Russian or Slavic. The Russian
  tsar used about two hundred years ago to be styled duke by foreign
  courts, but he has advanced in the nomenclature of royalty to be an
  emperor. The Russians use the word <i>imperatore</i> for emperor,
  <i>Kesar</i> for Cæsar, and <i>samodershetse</i> for sovereign.</p>

  <p>In Voltaire's <i>History of the Russian Empire</i>, it is stated that
  the title of Czar may possibly be derived front the <i>Tzars</i> or
  <i>Tchars</i> of the kingdom of Casan. When John, or Ivan Basilides,
  Grand Prince of Russia, had completed the reduction of this kingdom, he
  assumed this title, and it has since continued to his successors. Before
  the reign of John Basilides, the sovereigns of Russia bore the name of
  <i>Velike Knez</i>, that is, great prince, great lord, great chief, which
  in Christian countries was afterwards rendered by that of great duke. The
  Czar Michael Federovitz, on occasion of the Holstein embassy, assumed the
  titles of Great Knez and Great Lord, Conservator of all the Russias,
  Prince of Wolodimir, Moscow, Novogorod, &amp;c., Tzar of Casan, Tzar of
  Astracan, Tzar of Siberia. The name of <i>Tzar</i> was therefore the
  title of those Oriental princes, and therefore it is more probable for it
  to have been derived from the <i>Tshas</i> of Persia than from the Roman
  Cæsars, whose name very likely never reached the ears of the Siberian
  Tzars on the banks of the Oby. In another part of Voltaire's
  <i>History</i>, when giving an account of the celebrated battle of Narva,
  where Charles XII., with nine thousand men and ten pieces of cannon,
  defeated "the Russian army with eighty thousand fighting men, supported
  by one hundred and forty-five pieces of cannon," he says, "Among the
  captives was the son of a King of Georgia, whom Charles sent to
  Stockholm; his name was <i>Mittelesky Czarowitz</i>, or Czar's Son, which
  is farther proof that the title of Czar or Tzar was not originally
  derived from the Roman Cæsars." To the above slightly abbreviated
  description may not be uninterestingly added the language of Voltaire,
  which immediately follows the first reference:</p>

  <p>I beg to inform J. S. A. that the right word is <i>Tsar</i>, and that
  it is the Russian word answering to our king or lord, the Latin
  <i>Rex</i>, the Persian <i>Shah</i>, &amp;c. There may be terms in other
  languages that have an affinity with it, but I believe we should seek in
  vain for a derivation.</p>

<h3>"LAND OF GREEN GINGER."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 160.)</p>

  <p>I wish that <span class="sc">R. W. Elliot</span> of Clifton, whom I
  recognise as a former inhabitant of Hull, had given the authority on
  which he states, that "It is so called from the sale of ginger having
  been chiefly carried on there in early times." The name of this street
  has much puzzled the local antiquaries; and having been for several years
  engaged on a work relative to the derivations, &amp;c., of the names of
  the streets of Hull, I have spared no pains to ascertain the history and
  derivation of the singular name of this street.</p>

  <p>I offer then a conjecture as to its derivation as follows:&mdash;The
  ground on which this street stands was originally the property of De la
  Pole, Duke of Suffolk, on which he had built his stately manor-house. On
  the attainder of the family it was seized by the king; and Henry VIII.
  several times held his court here, on one of his visits having presented
  his sword to the corporation. It was then, 1538, called Old Beverley
  Street, as seen in the survey made of the estates of Sir William Sydney,
  Kt. In a romance called <i>Piraute el Blanco</i>, it is stated "The
  morning collation at the English Court was <i>green ginger</i> with good
  Malmsey, which was their custom, because of the coldness of the land."
  And in the <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, vii. 233., it is stated that, among other
  things, the cargo of a Genoese ship, which was driven ashore at Dunster,
  in Somersetshire, in 1380, consisted of green ginger (ginger cured with
  lemon-juice). In Hollar's Map of Hull, 1640, the street is there laid out
  as built upon, but without any name attached to it. No other plans of
  Hull are at present known to exist from the time of Hollar, 1640, to
  Gent, 1735. In Gent's plan of Hull, it is there called "The Land of Green
  Ginger;" so that probably, between the years 1640 and 1735, it received
  its peculiar name.</p>

  <p>I therefore conjecture that, as Henry VIII. kept his Court here with
  his usual regal magnificence, green ginger would be one of the luxuries
  of his table; that this portion of his royal property being laid out as a
  garden, was peculiarly suitable for the growth of ginger&mdash;the same
  as Pontefract was for the growth of the liquorice plant; and that, upon
  the property being built upon, the remembrance of this spot being so
  suitable for the growth of ginger for the Court, would eventually give
  the peculiar name, in the same way that the adjoining street of
  Bowl-Alley-Lane received its title from the bowling-green near to it.</p>

  </div>
  <p>This has long been a puzzle to the Hull antiquaries. I have often
  inquired of old persons likely to know the origin of such names of places
  at that sea-port as "The Land of Green Ginger," "Pig Alley,"
  "Mucky-south-end," and "Rotten Herring Staith;" and I have come to the
  conclusion, that "The Land of Green Ginger" was a very dirty place where
  horses were kept: a mews, in short, which none of the Muses, not even
  with Homer as an exponent, could exalt (<span title="'Epea pteroenta en athanatoisi theoisi'" class="grk"

  of poesy.</p>

  <p>Ginger has been cultivated in this country as a <i>stove</i> exotic
  for about two hundred and fifty years. In one of the histories of Hull,
  ginger is supposed to have grown in this street, where, to a recent
  period, the stables of the George Inn, and those of a person named Foster
  opposite, occupied the principal portion of the short lane called "Land
  of Green Ginger." It is hardly possible that the true zingiber can have
  grown here, even in the manure heaps; but a plant of the same order
  (<i>Zingiberaceæ</i>) may have been mistaken for it. Some of the old
  women or marine school-boys of the Trinity House, in the adjoining lane
  named from that guild, or some druggist, may have dropped, either
  accidentally or experimentally, a root, if not of the ginger, yet of some
  kindred plant. The magnificent <i>Fuchsia</i> was first noticed in the
  possession of a seaman's wife by Fuchs in 1501, a century prior to the
  introduction of the ginger plant into England.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Angles</i>.&mdash;The discussion in "N. &amp; Q."
  relative to the best angle for stereoscopic pictures has gone far towards
  a satisfactory conclusion: there are, however, still a few points which
  may be beneficially considered.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the kind of stereoscope to be used must tend to
  modify the mental impression; and secondly, the <i>amount</i> of
  reduction from the size of the original has a considerable influence on
  the final result.</p>

  <p>If in viewing a stereoscopic pair of photographs, they are placed
  <i>at the same distance</i> from the eyes as the <i>length of the focus
  of the lens used in producing them</i>, then without doubt the distance
  between the eyes, viz. about two and a quarter <!-- Page 228 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>inches, is the best
  difference between the two points of view to produce a perfectly natural
  result; and if the points of operation be more distant from one another,
  as I have before intimated, an effect is produced similar to what would
  be the case if the pictures were taken from a <i>model</i> of the object
  instead of the object itself.</p>

  <p>When it is intended that the pictures taken are to be viewed by an
  instrument that requires their distance from the eyes to be <i>less</i>
  than the focal length of the lens used in their formation, what is the
  result? Why, that they subtend an angle larger than in nature, and are
  consequently apparently <i>increased</i> in bulk; and the obvious remedy
  is to <i>increase</i> the angle between the points of generation in the
  exact ratio as that by which the visual distance is to be lessened. There
  is one other consideration to which I would advert, viz. that as we judge
  of <i>distance</i>, &amp;c. mainly by the degree of <i>convergence</i> of
  the optic axes of our two eyes, it cannot be so good to arrange the
  camera with its two positions quite parallel, especially for objects at a
  short or medium distance, as to let its centre radiate from the principal
  object to be delineated; and to accomplish this desideratum in the
  readiest way (for portraits especially), the ingenious contrivance of Mr.
  Latimer Clark, described in the <i>Journal</i> of the Photographic
  Society, appears to me the best adapted. It consists of a modification of
  the old parallel ruler arrangement on which the camera is placed; but one
  of the sides has an adjustment, so that within certain limits any degree
  of convergence is attainable. Now in the case of the pictures alluded to
  by <span class="sc">Mr. H. Wilkinson</span> in Vol. viii., p. 181., it is
  probable they were taken by a camera placed in two positions parallel to
  one another, and it is quite clear that only a <i>portion</i> of the two
  pictures could have been really stereoscopic. It is perfectly true that
  two indifferent negatives will often combine and form one good
  stereoscopic positive, but this is in consequence of one possessing that
  in which the other is deficient; and at any rate two <i>good</i> pictures
  will have a <i>better</i> effect; consequently, it is better that the two
  views should contain exactly the same <i>range</i> of vision.</p>

  <p><i>Protonitrate of Iron</i>.&mdash;"Being in the habit of using
  protonitrate of iron for developing collodion pictures, the following
  method of preparing that solution suggested itself to me, which appears
  to possess great advantages:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Water                       1 oz.</p>
      <p>Protosulphate of iron      14 grs.</p>
      <p>Nitrate of potash          10 grs.</p>
      <p>Acetic acid                 ½ drm.</p>
      <p>Nitric acid                 2 drops.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In this mixture nitrate of potash is employed to convert the sulphate
  of iron into nitrate in place of nitrate of baryta in Dr. Diamond's
  formula, or nitrate of lead as recommended by Mr. Sisson; the advantage
  being that no filtering is required, as the sulphate of potash (produced
  by the double decomposition) is soluble in water, and does not interfere
  with the developing qualities of the solution.</p>

  <p>"The above gives the bright deposit of silver so much admired in Dr.
  Diamond's pictures, and will be found to answer equally well either for
  positives or negatives. If the nitric acid be omitted, we obtain the
  effects of protonitrate of iron prepared in the usual way.&mdash;<span

  <p><i>Photographs in natural Colours</i>.&mdash;As "N. &amp; Q." numbers

  <i>Photography</i>, of Mr. Hill of New York having "obtained more than
  fifty pictures from nature in all the beauty of native coloration," or
  whether the statement is, as I conclude Professor Hunt is inclined to

  <p><i>Photographs by artificial Lights</i>.&mdash;May I ask for

  the view of obtaining photographs by means of artificial lights? This is,
  I have no doubt, a subject of interest to many who, like myself, are
  busily occupied during the day, and have only their evenings for
  scientific pursuits: while it is obvious, that if such a process can be
  successfully practised, there are many objects&mdash;such as
  <i>prints</i>, <i>coins</i>, <i>seals</i>, <i>objects of natural history
  and antiquity</i>&mdash;which might well be copied by it, even though
  artificial light should prove far slower in its action than solar
  light.</p>

  The only rule which occurs to me is to pronounce it in all words coming
  to us from the Celtic "stock," and to pass it unsounded in those which
  are of Latin origin. If this rule be admitted, the pronunciation
  sanctioned by the pulpit and Mr. Dickens is condemned.</p>

  M. E. of Philadelphia laughing at us, when he refers us to a
  <i>woodcut</i> in some American pictorial publication on the American
  Revolution for a true portraiture of the figure and features of King
  George III.; different, I presume, from that which I gave you. His
  woodcut, he says, is taken "from an English engraving;" he does not tell
  us who either painter or engraver was&mdash;but no matter. We have
  hundreds of portraits by the best hands which confirm my description,
  which moreover was the result of personal observation: for, from the
  twentieth to the thirtieth years of my life, I had frequent and close
  opportunities of approaching his Majesty. I cannot but express my
  surprise that "N. &amp; Q." should have given insertion to anything so
  absurd&mdash;to use the gentlest term&mdash;as M.&nbsp;E.'s appeal to his

  find the fragment of the ballad he is in search of commencing with the
  above line, in the second volume of the <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish

  an old woman, who weeded his garden."</p>

  <p>Since the death of Mr. Surtees, however, it has been ascertained that
  this ballad, as well as "The Death of Featherstonhaugh," and some others
  in the same collection, were composed by him and passed off upon Scott as
  genuine old Scottish ballads.</p>

  known.</p>

  <p>And it may not be out of place to remark, that being one of a party in
  the winter of 1830, travelling overland from Smyrna to Ephesus, we
  reached a place just before sunset where a roving band of Turcomans had
  encamped for the night. On nearing these people we observed that the
  women were preparing food for their supper, while the men were employed
  in branding with a hot iron, under the camel's upper lip, their own
  peculiar mark,&mdash;a very necessary precaution, it must be allowed,
  with people who are so well known for their pilfering propensities, not
  only practised on each other, but also on all those who come within their
  neighbourhood. Having as strangers paid our tribute to their great
  dexterity in their profession, the circumstance was published at the

  without being conscious at the time of the similarity of the expression.
  I was asking an old man, who had been absent from home, where he had been
  to? His reply was, "To Old Weston, Sir. You know I must go there before I
  die." Knowing that he had relatives living there, I did not, at the time,
  notice anything extraordinary in the answer; but, since reading <span
  class="sc">Arun's</span> note, I have made some inquires, and find the
  saying is a common one on this (the Northamptonshire) side of Old Weston,
  as well as in Huntingdonshire. I have been unable to obtain any
  explanation of it, but think the one suggested by your correspondent must
  be right. One of my informants (an old woman upwards of seventy) told me
  she had often heard it used, and wondered what could be its meaning, when
  she was a child.</p>

  mistakes, I think, the meaning of the lines. The idea is not that the
  Laird was less than a gentleman, but that he was a gentleman of mark; at
  least, I have never heard any other interpretation put upon it in
  Scotland, where the ballad of "We'll gang nae mair a-roving," is a great
  favourite. King James is the <i>subject</i> of the ballad. That merry
  monarch made many lively escapades, and on this occasion he personated a
  beggarman. The damsel, to whom he successfully paid his addresses, saw
  through the disguise at first; but from the king's good acting, when he
  pretended to be afraid that the dongs would "rive his meal pokes," she
  began to think she had been mistaken. Then she expressed her disgust by
  saying, that she had thought her lover could not be anything less than
  the Laird of Brodie, the highest untitled gentleman probably in the

  is not included in the list; therefore, if he was born in Chester, his
  baptism must have been registered at one of the many other parish
  churches of this city. The registers of St. Peter's Church, a
  neighbouring parish, have also been <!-- Page 233 --><span

  against his hip; and immediately behind him his horse is held by an
  equerry, supposed to be the Marquis of Hamilton. The picture hangs in the
  great square room at the Louvre, close on the left hand of the usual
  entrance door, and is undoubtedly one of the finest in that magnificent
  collection. As a portrait, it is without a rival. It is well known in

  <p><i>Strut-Stowers and Yeathers or Yadders</i> (Vol. viii., p.

  some of the monks of the abbey; on what grounds he does not say. The
  records of the abbey contain no allusion to the legend; and no ancient
  MS. of it, either in Latin or English, has ever been produced. The
  <i>penny-hedge</i> is yearly renewed to this day but it is a service

  stay. <i>Stower</i>, in Bailey's <i>Dictionary</i>, is a stake; Halliwell
  spells it <i>stoure</i>, and says it is still in use. Forby connects the
  Norfolk word <i>stour</i>, stiff, inflexible, applied to standing corn,
  with this word, which he says is Lowland Scotch, and derives them both
  from Sui.-G. <i>stoer</i>, stipes. A <i>yeather</i> or <i>yadder</i>
  seems to be a rod to wattle the stakes with. In Norfolk, wattling a live
  fence is called <i>ethering</i> it, which word, evidently with
  <i>yeather</i>, may be derived from A.-S. <i>ether</i> or <i>edor</i>, a
  hedge. The barons, therefore, had to drive their stakes perpendicularly
  into the sand, to put the strut-stowers diagonally to enable them to
  withstand the force of the tide, and finally to wattle them together with
  the yeathers.</p>

  <p><i>Arms of See of York</i> (Vol. viii., p. 111.).&mdash;It appears
  that the arms of the See of York were certainly changed during Wolsey's
  time, for on the vaulting of Christ Church Gate, Canterbury, is a shield
  bearing (in sculpture) the same arms as those now used by the
  Metropolitan See of Canterbury, impaling those of Wolsey, and over the
  shield a cardinal's hat. This gateway was built in 1517; yet in the
  parliament roll of 6th Henry VIII., 1515, the <i>keys</i> and
  <i>crown</i> are impaled with the arms of Wolsey as Archbishop of York
  (see fac-simile, published by Willement, 4to. Lond. 1829), showing that
  the alteration was not generally known when the gateway was built.</p>

  <p>Although the charges on the earlier arms of the See of York were the
  same as on that of Canterbury, the colours of their fields differed; for
  in a north window of the choir of York Minster is a shield of arms,
  bearing the arms of Archbishop Bowett, who held the see from 1407 to
  1423, impaled by the pall and pastoral staff, on a field <i>gules</i>.
  The glass is to all appearance of the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p><i>Leman Family</i> (Vol. viii., p. 150.).&mdash;Without being able to
  give a substantial reply to R.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;L.'s Query, it may assist him to know
  that Sir John Leman had but <i>one</i> brother (William), who certainly
  did not emigrate from his native land. Sir John died, March 26, 1632,
  without issue; and was buried in the chancel of St. Michael, Crooked
  Lane, London. His elder brother, William, had five sons; all settled
  comfortably in England, and not at all likely to have left their native
  country. One of the <i>Heralds' Visitations</i> for the counties of
  Norfolk or Suffolk would materially assist your Philadelphian

  <p><i>Position of Font</i> (Vol. vii., p. 149.).&mdash;In the church of
  Milton near Cambridge, the font is <i>built into</i> the north pier of
  the chancel arch; and from the appearance of the masonry, &amp;c., this
  is evidently the original position. I have visited some hundreds of
  churches, and this is the only instance I have observed of a font in this
  position. Numerous instances occur where it is <i>built into</i> the
  south-western pier of the nave.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Our worthy publisher has just issued a volume which will be welcome,
  for the excellence of its matter and the beauty of its various
  illustrations, to all archæologists. These <i>Memoirs illustrative of the
  History and Antiquities of Bristol and the Western Counties of Great
  Britain, and other Communications made to the Annual Meeting of the
  Archæological Institute held at Bristol in 1851</i>, certainly equal in
  interest and variety any of their predecessors, and whether as a memorial
  of their visit to Bristol to those who attended the meeting, or as a
  pleasant substitute to those who did not, will doubtless find a
  resting-place on the shelf of every member of the Society whose
  proceedings they record.</p>

  <p>We cannot better recommend to our readers Dr. Madden's newly published
  <i>Life and Martyrdom of Savonarola, illustrative of the History of
  Church and State Connexion</i>, than by stating that this remarkable man,
  whom some Protestants have claimed as of their own creed, while as many
  Romanists have rejected him as a heretic, is viewed by Dr. Madden as a
  monk of Florence at the close of the fifteenth century, who was of
  opinion that the mortal enemy of Christ's gospel in all ages of the world
  had been mammon; that simony was the sin against the Holy Ghost; that the
  interests of religion were naturally allied with those of liberty; that
  the Arts were the handmaids of both, of a Divine origin, and were given
  to earth for purposes that tended to spiritualise humanity; and who
  directed all his teachings, preachings, and writings to one great object,
  namely, <i>the separation of religion from all worldly influences</i>. On
  this theme Dr. Madden discourses with great learning, and, some few
  passages excepted, with great moderation; and the result is a Life of
  Savonarola, which gives a far more complete view of his character and his
  writings than has heretofore been attempted.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received</span>.&mdash;<i>History of England
  from the Peace of Utrecht to the Peace of Versailles</i>, by Lord Mahon,
  Vol. V. This volume embraces the period between the early years of George
  III. and 1774, when Franklin was dismissed from his office of Deputy
  Postmaster-General; and, as it includes the Junius period, gives occasion
  to Lord Mahon to avow his adherence to "the Franciscan theory;" while the
  Appendix contains two letters in support of the same view,&mdash;one from
  Sir James Macintosh, and one from Mr. Macaulay.&mdash;<i>Confessions of a
  Working Man, from the French of Emile Souvestre</i>. This interesting
  narrative, well deserving the attention both of masters and working men,
  forms Part XLVIII. of Longman's <i>Traveller's
  Library.</i>&mdash;<i>Remains of Pagan Saxondom, principally from Tumuli
  in England, drawn from the Originals:</i> described and illustrated by
  J.&nbsp;Y. Akerman, Part VI. containing coloured engravings of the size of the
  originals of Fibulæ and Bullæ, from cemeteries in Kent; and Fibulæ,
  Beads, &amp;c. from a grave near Stamford.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,

  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and

  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the

  <p>SOME ACCOUNT of DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE in ENGLAND, from the Conquest to
  the end of the Thirteenth Century, with numerous Illustrations of
  Existing Remains from Original Drawings. By T. HUDSON TURNER.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What Horace Walpole attempted, and what Sir Charles Lock Eastlake has
  done for oil-painting&mdash;elucidated its history and traced its
  progress in England by means of the records of expenses and mandates of
  the successive Sovereigns of the realm&mdash;Mr. Hudson Turner has now
  achieved for Domestic Architecture in this century during the twelfth and
  thirteenth centuries."&mdash;<i>Architect.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The writer of the present volume ranks among the most intelligent of
  the craft, and a careful perusal of its contents will convince the reader
  of the enormous amount of labour bestowed on its minutest details as well
  as the discriminating judgement presiding over the general
  arrangement."&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The book of which the title is given above is one of the very few
  attempts that have been made in this country to treat this interesting
  subject in anything more than a superficial manner.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and research, and he has
  consequently laid before the reader much interesting information. It is a
  book that was wanted, and that affords us some relief from the mass of
  works on Ecclesiastical Architecture with which of late years we have
  been deluged.</p>

  <p>"The work is well illustrated throughout with wood-engravings of the
  more interesting remains, and will prove a valuable addition to the
  antiquary's library."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is as a text-book on the social comforts and condition of the
  Squires and Gentry of England during the twelfth and thirteenth
  centuries, that the leading value of Mr. Turner's present publication
  will be found to consist.</p>

  <p>"Turner's handsomely-printed volume is profusely illustrated with
  careful woodcuts of all important existing remains, made from drawings by
  Mr. Blore and Mr. Twopeny."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

  <p>THE DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIDDLE AGES. Vol. II.&mdash;THE
  FOURTEENTH CENTURY. By the Editor of "The Glossary of Architecture."</p>

  <p>This volume is issued on the plan adopted by the late Mr. Hudson
  Turner in the previous volume: viz., collecting matter relating to
  Domestic buildings of the period, from cotemporary records, and applying
  the information so acquired to the existing remains.</p>

  <p>Not only does the volume contain much curious information both as to
  the buildings and manners and customs of the time, but it is also hoped
  that the large collection of careful Engravings of the finest examples
  will prove as serviceable to the profession and their employers in
  building mansions, as the Glossary was found to be in building
  churches.</p>

  <p>The Text is interspersed throughout with numerous woodcuts.</p>
